# Getting Started with Create React App

#Welcome to my GitHub repository for my React JS project developed for my course at the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional Regional Buenos Aires UTN. The project, which is entirely in Spanish, is a basic Eshop built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React, and Firebase. The Eshop displays products extracted through a Mercadolibre API. In its first phase, it features an authenticated login and registration through Firebase. In the second phase, it includes pages for adding, editing, and consuming product data from Firebase using CRUD operations. I hope you find this project helpful and informative.

#Bienvenidos a mi repositorio GitHub para mi proyecto React JS desarrollado para mi curso en la Universidad Tecnológica Nacional Regional Buenos Aires UTN. El proyecto, totalmente en español, es una tienda en línea básica construida utilizando HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React y Firebase. La tienda muestra productos extraídos a través de la API de Mercadolibre. En su primera fase, cuenta con un inicio de sesión y registro autenticados mediante Firebase. En la segunda fase, se incluyen páginas para agregar, editar y consumir datos de productos desde Firebase mediante operaciones CRUD. Espero que este proyecto les resulte útil e informativo.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
